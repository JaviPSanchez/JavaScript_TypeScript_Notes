In this section, let's actually deploy our projects to a live server, or as we can also say, we will host the application on the internet to share it with everyone.

And we will do deployment using an amazing and free service called Netlify. Then we'll also learn the fundamentals of Git, which is a version control software. And Git is something that every professional developer uses. So you will definitely need Git on your first development job and so it's a good idea to learn it.
