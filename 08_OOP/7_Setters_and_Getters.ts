/*
Let's now talk about a feature that is actually common to all objects in JavaScript, and that's
getters and setters. So every object in JavaScript can have setter and getter properties. And
we call these special properties assessor properties, while the more normal properties are called
data properties.

So getters and setters are basically functions that get and set a value so just as the name says,
but on the outside they still look like regular properties.

Let's first take a look at getters and setters in a simple object literal, we will add a getter
method and a setter method (needs to have exactly one parameter):
*/
const account = {
  owner: 'jonas',
  movements: [200, 530, 100, 300],

  // Getter
  get latest() {
    return this.movements.slice(-1).pop();
  },
  // Setter
  set latest(mov: any) {
    this.movements.push(mov);
  },
};
account.latest = 50;
console.log(account.movements);
/*
Classes do also have getters and setters, and they do indeed work in the exact same way.
