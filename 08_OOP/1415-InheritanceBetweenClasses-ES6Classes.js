/*
Let's now go ahead and implement the exact same thing that we did in the last video, but this time using ES6 classes instead of constructor functions.

So here again, I copied the initial person class that we built a bit earlier so that now we can inherit from this class.

And so down here, let's now create the student class. So class Student like this:
*/
class Student {}
/*
Now, as we know already, the class Syntax hides a lot of the details that are actually happening behind the scenes, because classes are really just a layer of obstruction over constructor functions. But that's no problem because we already learned how inheritance between classes actually works behind the scenes.

And so now that we know how it works, we are ready to implement the same thing using classes, even though that hides, how it actually works behind the scenes. So to implement inheritance between ES6 classes, we only need two ingredients.

We need the extent keywords and we need the super function.

So to make this student class inherit from the person class, all we need to do is to say extends and then the person class:
*/
class Student extends PersonCl {}
/*
and this one, I'm also going to call Cl here just to follow the same name and that's actually it:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {}
/*
So this keyword alone here will then link to prototypes behind the scenes without us even having to think about that. Then of course, we still need a constructor. And this one will just like before receive the same arguments as the parent class, but then some additional ones. So birth year, and also the course. Remember?:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {}
}
/*
now here, we actually don't even need to manually call like PersonCl.call like we did before in the constructor function. Remember? so here we don't need to do that. What we do instead is to call the super function:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    // PersonCL.call()
    super();
  }
}
/*
// And so super is basically the constructor function of the parent class. So the idea is still similar to what we did in the constructor function, but here it all happens automatically. We don't need to specify the name of the parent class again, because that already happened up here. So here now all we do is to pass in the arguments for the constructor of the parent class. And so that's these two, because that's exactly the parameters that are also specified here in the parent's constructor
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    // PersonCL.call()
    super(fullName, birthYear);
  }
}
/*
Now here in this constructor. So off the child class, this always needs to happens first.  And that's because this call to the super function is responsible for creating
the this keyword in this subclass.
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    // Always needs to happen first!
    super(fullName, birthYear);
  }
}
/*
And so therefore, without doing this, we wouldn't be able to access the this keyword to do this:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    // Always needs to happen first!
    super(fullName, birthYear);
    //Access this keyword
    this.course = course;
  }
}
/*
So always first the call to the super so to the parents class constructor.
And from there, we will then be able to access the this keyword. Now, of course we could actually have no other properties here at all.

this.course = course;

So this is not necessary. I mean, it's not mandatory. And so the same goes for this additional parameter "course". So in this case, this new student class would simply have new methods and share all the properties with the parent class. So what we're doing here is really just an example, but the possibilities are endless.

And actually, if we didn't want to do this:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    // Always needs to happen first!
    super(fullName, birthYear);
    //Access this keyword
    // this.course = course;
  }
}
/*
then we wouldn't need any constructor function at all. So in this case, the super function would automatically be called with all the arguments that are passed into this constructor.

So let me just create a new student here:
*/
const martha = new StudentCl('Martha Jones', 2012, 'Computer Science');
/*
So that's Martha. So a new studentCL let's say Martha Jones born in 2012 and also studying computer science now. Right? But let me duplicate this year very quick,

take this one out and only call this with these two:
*/
const martha = new StudentCl('Martha Jones', 2012);
/*
And then as I was saying, we could have no constructor at all, and this would still work just the same:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    // Always needs to happen first!
    // super(fullName, birthYear);
    // Access this keyword
    // this.course = course;
  }
}
/*
So you see that now we would end up with a student with the full name and the birth year, just as specified.

Now, remember that this underscore here still comes from this set function here:

set fullName(name) {
    console.log(name);
    if (name.includes(' ')) this._fullName = name;
    else alert(`${name} is not a full name!`);
  }


So that's what we specified earlier. And so of course now the student will inherit all of that because in the end, these are really just methods too. And so all the students will now inherit all of these methods from the parent class.

But anyway, this was just to demonstrate to you that if you do not need any new properties, then you don't even need to bother writing a constructor method in the child class.

But now let's take this back:
*/

class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    super(fullName, birthYear);
    this.course = course;
  }
}

const martha = new StudentCl('Martha Jones', 2012, 'Computer Science');
/*
and now let's see if this worked (escribimos en console martha, hacemos enter y obtenemos: StudentCl {_fullName: "Martha Jones", birthYear: 2012, course: "Computer Science"})

and yeah, so now we have all the three properties here. Okay? Now let's just quickly add the introduce method:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    super(fullName, birthYear);
    this.course = course;
  }
  introduce() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.fullName} and I study ${this.course}`);
  }
}
const martha = new StudentCl('Martha Jones', 2012, 'Computer Science');
/*
So that's the simple console.log that we're going to execute here. So introduce, and so now we can call that on:
*/
martha.introduce(); //My name is Martha and I study Computer Science
/*
And so now that actually works and the same should work for the calcAge method that is in the parent class:
*/
martha.calcAge(); //25
/*
and indeed, that works as well. And so let's now take a quick look here at a prototype chain one more time, just so you can see that a prototype chain is actually just the same as before when we created it manually:

StudentCl {_fullName: "Martha Jones", birthYear: 2012, course: "Computer Science"}
birthYear: 2012
course: "Computer Science"
_fullName: "Martha Jones"
age: (...)
fullName: (...)
__proto__: PersonCl
age: (...)
constructor: class StudentCl
fullName: (...)
introduce: Æ’ introduce() --> introduce() {console.log(`My name is ${.....
__proto__: Object

So you see that indeed in a prototype of Martha, we now have the introduce method. So that's this one right here that we wrote in the class. All right? But now in the prototype after prototype, we have indeed the calcAge method and also the greet method and the age and full name setters and getters.

StudentCl {_fullName: "Martha Jones", birthYear: 2012, course: "Computer Science"}
birthYear: 2012
course: "Computer Science"
_fullName: "Martha Jones"
age: (...)
fullName: (...)
__proto__: PersonCl
age: (...)
constructor: class StudentCl
fullName: (...)
introduce: Æ’ introduce()
__proto__:
age: (...)
calcAge: Æ’ calcAge()
constructor: class PersonCl
fullName: (...)
greet: Æ’ greet()
get age: Æ’ age()
get fullName: Æ’ fullName()
set fullName: Æ’ fullName(name)
__proto__: Object

And so this proves us that the prototype chain was indeed set up automatically by basically by this extends keyword here:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    super(fullName, birthYear);
    this.course = course;
  }
}
/*
Now. Finally, just like we did in a previous challenge, let's override one of the methods of the parent class. So let's override the calcAge method here:

calcAge() {
    console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
}

And so all we have to do is to add a new CalcAge right here:
*/
class StudentCl extends PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear, course) {
    super(fullName, birthYear);
    this.course = course;
  }
  introduce() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.fullName} and I study ${this.course}`);
  }
  calcAge() {
    console.log(
      `I'm ${
        2037 - this.birthYear
      } years old, but as a student I feel more like ${
        2037 - this.birthYear + 10
      }`
    );
  }
}

const martha = new StudentCl('Martha Jones', 2012, 'Computer Science');
martha.introduce();
martha.calcAge(); //I'm 25 years old, but as a student I feel more like 35
/*
And so now indeed, this new method overrode the one that was already there in the prototype chain. And again, that's because this new calcAge method here appears first in the prototype chain. And so therefore it is essentially overriding the method coming from the parent class. And we can also say that this calcAge method here is shadowing the one that is in the parent class.

And so that's actually, it, that's all I have to show you about implementing inheritance between classes, using actual ES6 classes. And just to make sure that you got this 100%, I invite you one more time to check out the slides from the previous lecture. So the lecture where we did the same thing using constructor functions.

So these slides, so these theory parts of the video, I believe are really, really helpful to understanding this. Now, to finish this part of inheritance between classes. Let me just say that this mechanism of inheritance that we explored here can actually be very problematic and dangerous in the real world when we are designing software. However, that's going to be a topic for another day. And we're going to talk a little bit about this when we talk about functional programming, which as I've mentioned, a couple of times is kind of the alternative to object oriented programming.

Anyway, next up, let's do the same thing with object.create. So that's the third way of implementing object oriented programming in JavaScript.
