/*
Now that we activated bundling it's time to configure Babel to transpile our super modern code back to ES5 code. And this is still important right now even many years after the new ES6 standard has been introduced. And the reason for that is simply that there are still many people out there who are stuck on like a windows XP or windows 7 computer!!! and they cannot upgrade their old internet explorers but we want our applications to work for everyone. And so we need to keep everyone in mind.

Now, the good news is that parcel actually automatically uses Babel to transpile or code. And we can configure Babel a lot if we want to for example defining exactly what browsers should be supported but as always, that's a ton of work.
And so we don't want that. And instead parcel makes some very good default decisions for us. And so we will simply mainly just go with these defaults.

Now just so you get a very broad and very general overview of how Babel works.
Let's just take a look at their website. So that's Babeljs.io and then here in the documentation let's take a look here at plugins. Okay. So basically Babel works with plugins and presets that can both be configured. Now a plugin is basically a specific JavaScript feature that we want to transpile. So to convert.
So for example let's say we only wanted to convert arrow functions back to ES5
but leave everything else in ES6 for example, const and var declarations.
Now usually that doesn't make a lot of sense because basically we will want to transpile everything at the same time.

And so usually instead of using single plugins for each of these features, Babel actually uses presets. And so a preset is basically a bunch of plugins bundled together. And its by default parcel is going to use this preset here.

@babel/preset-env

And this preset will automatically select which JavaScript features should be compiled based on browser support. And again that will all happen automatically
and out of the box Babel will convert all features So only browsers that are barely used anymore with the market share of less than 0.25% are not going to be supported by the transpiling with this preset here.

So, that's a very brief overview and we will come back here in a second but for now let's start on npm run start script again:

👉 npm run start

just so we can take a look again at our final output.

And so now the script it ads:

<script defer="" src="/index.f8345a9e.js"></script>

So this one and we can see right away that ES6 is no longer there. So here we have var instead of const that we had before. Let's see if we have something else.
There are not template literal either. So everything that we used from ES6 is now gone. But now let me show you something important.

So let's write some code here which is basically not part of this preset here:

@babel/preset-env

because this preset-env does actually only include final features. So features that are already part of the language after passing the four stages of the AGMA process.

However, previously we used class fields which at the time of recording are only at stage three. And so let me show you how we could transpile a class fields as well. So let's just write a simple example here:
*/
class Person {
  //We make this private with #:
  #greeting = 'Hey';
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log(`${this.#greeting}, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
const javi = new Person('Javi'); //Hey, Javi
/*
Podemos ver como lo convierte en ES5:







maybe then we get the error i was expecting

but actually no, everything is working great.

Let me just search our code here for person.

And so here you can see

that the person class has nicely been converted to ES5.

So the class keyword is nowhere to be found anymore.

And then our entire code

that we had here was basically converted to this, all right?

And so therefore there's actually no more need

for what I was going to show you

which we had to do before

which was to include

this a plugin here for the class properties

because this is still an experimental feature.

And so yeah, we had to manually include this plugin here

in order to make this code work

but now that's no longer necessary.

And so that makes this even more amazing

but let's try another experimental one

for example, this knowledge coalescing operator

which is still also a bit more on the experimental side.

So let's say Jonah's or null, let's say.

And so that actually works as well.

Okay great.

Now there's still two more things

that I need to show you here still.

And so let's write some more code here.

So what I will do now is to use the ES6 find method

to find products in a cart

that are edit more than twice.

So that's I believe just cart.

So cart.find

because remember this is an ES6 method

and then return.quantity where it's greater or equal to.

And so that is only the pizza here.

So you see, well

maybe this isn't a cart, let's see what's happening.

Oh but never mind.

This is not filter.

It is just find, so it will simply find

the first element, right?

And so this is the first element

where the quantity is greater to.

But anyway, what I want to show you here

is that well let me show it to you actually first.

So to find this code here in this other script

I will copy this part and then put it here.

And so you'll see that here is basically that same code.

So the arrow function that we had is gone

and it was replaced by this regular function.

However, the ES6 method find is still here.

So it has not been converted to ES5.

Now the same is too for other things

for example, let's try promises.

So promise.resolve

So we're creating an immediately

resolved promise to make this really a quick example.

And let's just log X to the console

and so that works

but it works because our browser understands ES6

because if we take a look here now

then promise is also not converted to ES5.

So remember promise is an ES6 feature

but again, it was not converted back to ES5

and the reason for that is that

Babel can actually only transpile ES6 Syntax.

So data things like arrow functions,

classes, const, or the spread operator.

So these are basically things

that have an equivalent way of writing them in ES5.

So for example the arrow function,

it is simply a different syntax.

And so Babel can simply write function instead of data.

And the same goes with const.

So it's very easy to simply convert that to VAR

but the same is not true for real new features

that were added to the language

like find and promise.

So these new additions to the language

so these new features, they can simply not be transpiled.

It's simply not possible.

Only syntax is easy to convert, so easy to compile.

However, all hope is not lost.

So for these added features

again, such as promises or all the array methods

like finds and really a bunch of other stuff,

we can polyfill them.

And so that's why since the beginning

I've always been saying transpiling and polyfilling.

So these new features, we have to polyfill them.

Now Babel used to do polyfilling

out of the box some time ago

but recently they started to simply

recommending another library.

And so we now have to manually import data as well.

So import Core-js so that's the name of the library.

And then we usually only want to import a part

of that library and that's called Stable.

And so we can write this.

Okay.

Now usually we have to install

all of the packages first

but fortunately parcel is smart

enough to install this automatically.

Well at least that is how it should be.

So maybe that doesn't work after all

so let's manually install it, but that's weird.

So core-js.

So let's see.

And so here we go.

So let's re-save it.

And so here we go.

Okay.

So you should probably

also try to install core-js manually

and then you will able to use it like this.

So maybe you're starting to see

that D things really change all the time.

And so, hi, I'm even confused myself sometimes

on why certain things used to work

and now they work differently.

But the good thing is

that you don't really have to understand all this.

So this is really more like a recipe

that you just need to follow.

And then with time it will all become like a routine

and it will become simple.

But anyway, let's go back to our code

but you will notice that's the code we had before

is actually still there.

So it's still the same

and promise and find have not been replaced.

And that's because that's simply not the way

it's supposed to work.

So instead what polyfilling does

is to basically recreate defined function

and to make it available in this bundle

so that the codes can then use it.

`So let's search for array.prototype

which remember, is where all the array methods are put.

So array.prototype.find.

And so, well here it is.

So Babel then uses this weird create methods.

But what matters here is that

this will basically implement array prototype find

and the same for find index,

every some filter map and also for each

even though these less ones here are not ES6

but for some reason they are still polyfilled here.

Oh right? And the same for promise, probably.

Well not probably for sure.

Otherwise this is not going to work

and it's not easy to find it

but well, here's the definition of promise

which is going to be global promise

but I'm not gonna dig even deeper into this.

That's just not really necessary.

However, as you just saw before

the polyfilling is going to polyfill everything

even if we don't need it.

So we had to D find index method there as well.

Let's actually go back there.

So array.prototype.find

So it also created find index and every, and some

and so we are actually not even using these.

And so if we wanted

we could cherry pick basically

just the features that we actually want to polyfill.

Now that of course is a lot of work

but it will also greatly reduce the bundle size.

And so it might be worth it

if that's really a concern.

So we could instead of this.

So instead of basically importing everything there is

we can just say core-js stable and then only array

and then find like this.

So now if we go back here,

then, well then only this one should be here.

(indistinct) It looks different now.

And so probably only this one was not polyfilled

At the same you could do for a promise

like this okay.

So that's going to be a lot of work

which we usually don't do

but it is possible again if you are really worried

about your bundle size.

Finally, just to finish there is still one feature

that is not polyfilled by this one here.

And so we always need to install

just one more package

which is called NPM install regenerator-runtime.

So regenerator.That's correct.

So let's see, let's already include it here.

So we need import, so regenerator-runtime/runtime like this.

Alright? So this here is for polyfilling async functions.

So again, it probably looks a bit confusing

that we have to do all of this, but yeah, don't worry.

It's just a recipe that you have to follow.

Okay. And usually you would put

these imports here right at the top of your file

but in this case, we can just leave them here

because they will be hosted anyway, right?

Also keep in mind that all of this might change.

And so if you're watching this video

like in two years from now,

then things might be different

and things might not work the same.

And so once again make sure

that you then install

exactly the same versions as I have here

especially this core-js and regenerator-runtime.

And of course, also parcel.

So just as I told you in the last video.

Now okay.

And with this, we're actually done with this video

and also with learning about Modern JavaScript Development.

So basically with learning about Tooling,

such as parcel and babel and also about modules.

Now in the remainder of this section,

so the next two videos

we will just quickly also talk

about modern JavaScript coding.

So more on the actual programming side of things.

And so there we will learn or actually more review

how to write clean and modern JavaScript code.
